 ## Logical Operators
 Logical operators either modify or combine Boolean logic values true or false. Swift supports three logical operators:
 * **NOT** (!a) Inverts a Boolean value so that `true` becomes `false` and `false` becomes `true`
 * **AND** (a && b) Creates a logical expression where both values need to be `true` for the overall experession to be `true`
 * **OR** (a || b) Creates a logical expression where just one of the two values has to be `true` for the overall expression to be `true`.
