 ## Functions - Naming
 The Swift API Guidelines gives us suggestions on how to name our functions.
 * Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases
 * Begin names of factory methods with `make`
 * Name functions and methods according to their side-effects
 * Take advantage of defaulted parameters
 * Prefer to locate parameters with defaults toward the end
 * Omit all labels when arguements can't be usefully distinguished
