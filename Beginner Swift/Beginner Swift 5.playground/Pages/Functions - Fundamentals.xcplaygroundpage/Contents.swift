 ## Functions - Fundamentals
 Functions are self-contained chunks of code that perform a **specific task**. A function is defined by a name by which we can call it by. It can take inputs known as **parameters** and it performs some kind of operation in its *scope* or *block*. A function can optionally return some kind of output after its operation. Functions help to reduce complexity in our code and make our code more reusable.
 
 At this point in the course we can now look at formal definitions of scope and block.
 
 A **block** groups a set of related statements that perform a particular task into a single organisational unit. They start with a opening curly brace ({) and end with a closing curly brace (}).
 
 A **scope** represents the period of time that an item is accessible from within our program. It defines an area of our program that an item is accessible. There are two types of scope: **global** and **local/nested**. By default, our code exists within the global scope. Local/nested scope represents anything that exists as a subset of a global scope usually a block.
 
 Functions can come with both **arguement labels** and **parameter names**. The arguement label is used when calling the function. The parameter name is used in the implementation of the function. Using arguement labels and parameter names makes our code more readable.
 
 Function parameters are constants by default. If you wish to change the value of a parameter inside of a function then you need to define it as an **in-out parameter**. This is done by placing the `inout` keyword before the parameter's type. You only pass a variable as the arguement for an in-out parameter.
