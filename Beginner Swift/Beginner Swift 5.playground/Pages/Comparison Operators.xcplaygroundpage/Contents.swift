 ## Comparison Operators
 Swift has six comparison operators which all result in a **true** or **false** value (a Boolean).
 * **Equal To** (a==b)
 * **Not Equal** (a!=b)
 * **Greater Than** (a>b)
 * **Less Than** (a<b)
 * **Greater Than or Equal To** (a>=b)
 * **Less Than or Equal To** (a<=b)
 
 Comparison operators are often used in conditional statements which are made with the `if` statement.
