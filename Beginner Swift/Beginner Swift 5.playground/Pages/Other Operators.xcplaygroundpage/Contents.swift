 ## Other Operators
 By definition, an operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change or combine values. There are three types of operators.
 1. **Unary** operators operate on a single target
 2. **Binary** operators operate on two targets
 3. **Ternary** operators operate on three targets.
 
 We have already met a few operators including assignment operators, arthimetic operators, comparison operators and logical operators. Here are a few more operators that are useful:
 
 * There are times we want to use a default value when an optional variable is `nil`. In this situation we use the **nil coalescing** operator which is denoted by `??`. It takes the form `(a ?? b)` where `a` is optional and if `a` is `nil` then the value `b` is used as default.
 * The **ternary operator** is a shorthand way of getting two possible values depending on whether a variable or constant is `true` or `false`. It takes the form `(a ? b : c)` where `a` should evaluate to `true` or `false` and if `a` is `true` the value `b` is returned but if `a` is `false` the value `c` is returned.
 * The **compound assigment** operator provides a shorthand way of applying an arthimetic operation. For example, instead of (b = b + 1) we could say (b += 1).
